# Start Launcher
This is an early version of a program designed to launch application and websites on button press.
It can be run on Windows boot and then turned on manually later.
At this stage, applications and websites can be added and run with a single button press.

Possible use cases include:
 - having to log into a corporate VPN before launching a lot of software that cannot run without it,
 - using the PC both for work and free time, meaning adding some software to automatically launch on boot would in one of those cases be unnecessary,
 - having a slower PC that cannot handle running everything just after booting.

# This is still just a pre-release. Expect bugs and ocasional breaking changes.

MSI installer is included in the newest release.
